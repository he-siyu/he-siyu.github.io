* **22q11.2DS modeling with blood vessel organoids (Finished)** 

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is a genetic disorder caused by microdeletions in the chromosome 22. The deficits in blood vessel development, such as abnormal aortic arch morphology, tortuous retinal vessels, and kidney anomalies have been observed in the patients with 22q11.2 DS. However, how dysfunction endothelial cells and pericytes contribute to the vasculopathy remains unknown. In this study, we used the 3D self-assembled human blood vessel organoids (VOs) generated from 22q11.2 patients iPSCs to model the vascular malformation and genetic dysfunctions. Combined high resolution light-sheet 3D imaging,  single cell transcriptome analysis and integrating deep learning approach, we determined that the VOs with 22q11.2 deletion have smaller VO size. The alterations in 22q11.2DS VO size is the results of  instability in vasculature network formation while increased angiogenesis/sprouting. Voronoi diagram-based tessellation analysis also indicated the colocalization of endothelial tubes and mural cells was less than normal indicating that alterations in EC and mural interactions might also contribute to the deficits in vascular network formation. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed the variations of VO heterogeneity with 22q11.2 deletion, including the organ specificity of endothelial cells, and vascular developmental processes. Intercellular communications indicated the vascular dysfunction in 22q11.2 deletion was assocated with less cell-cell communications, and upregulation of ECM receptor in EC and vascular associated cells. We conclude that our study reveal important insight on pathogenesis of 22q11.2 deletion vasculopathy.
